- **Reason**
    1. The animation in this work is not updated according to the draw function, and it will stay for a while after generating a new image and then change. 
    2. I think this helps to control the animation rendering without device interaction, making each part of the scene present rhythmically rather than refreshing at any time.

- **Reason**
   - Although the original image animation is generated by async/await functions, it is a bit too complicated for me. Maybe a foor loop and if statements can also be used to simply draw different stages of the animation and reset the screen according to the state of millis(). 
   - For example, call the different functions to draw the image every 1000 seconds. Keeping all elements still in a certain part to achieve a short stagnation
